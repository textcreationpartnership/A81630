            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>My Lords,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Shall take the boldneſſe to ſpeak a word or two upon this ſubject, firſt as it is in it ſelfe, then as it is in the conſequence: For the former I thinke hee is a great ſtranger in Antiquity, that is not well acquainted with that of their ſitting here, they have done thus and in this manner, almoſt ſince the conqueſt, and by the ſame power and the ſame right the other Peeres did, and your Lordſhips now doe, and to be put from this their due, ſo much their due, by ſo many hundred yeeres ſtrengthened and confirmed,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:157486:3"/> and that without any offence, nay, pretence of any, ſeems to mee to be very ſevere; if it be <hi>jus,</hi> I dare boldly ſay it is <hi>ſummum.</hi> That this hinders their Eccleſiaſticall vocation, an argument I heare much of, hath in my apprehenſion more of ſhadow then ſubſtance in it: if this be a reaſon, ſure I am it might have been one ſix hundred yeers ago.</p>
            <p>A Biſhop, my Lords, is not ſo circumſcribed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the circumference of his Dioceſſe, that his ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times abſence can bee termed, no not in the moſt ſtrict ſenſe a neglect or hinderance of his duty, no more then that of a Lievtenant from his County, they both have their ſubordinate Miniſters, upon which their influences fall, though the diſtance be remote.</p>
            <p>Beſides, my Lords, the leſſer muſt yield to the greater good; to make wholſome and good Laws for the happy and well regulating of Church and Common-wealth, is certainly more advantagious to both, then the want of the perſonall execution of their office, and that but once in three yeers, and then peradventure but a moneth or two, can be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiciall to either. I will go no further to prove this, which ſo long experience hath done ſo fully, ſo demonſtratively.</p>
            <p>And now my Lords, by your Lordſhips good leave, I ſhall ſpeak to the conſequence as it reflects both on your Lordſhips, and my Lords the Biſhops. Dangers &amp; inconveniences are ever beſt prevented <hi>è longinquo;</hi> this preſident comes neere to your Lordſhips, and ſuch a one, that <hi>mutato nomine devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis.</hi> Pretences are never wanting, nay, ſometimes
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:157486:3"/> the greateſt evils appeare in the moſt faire and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious outſides, witneſſe the Shipmony, the moſt abominable, the moſt illegall thing that ever was, and yet this was painted over with colour of the Law; what Bench is ſecure, if to alleage, be to convince, and which of your Lordſhips can ſay then hee ſhall continue a member of this Houſe, when at one blow twenty ſixe are cut off. It then behoves the Neighbour to look about him <hi>cum pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximus ardet Vcalegon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for the Biſhops, my Lords, in what condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will you leave them? The Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons repreſents the meaneſt perſon, ſo did the Maſter his Slave, but they have none to doe ſo much for them, and what juſtice can tie them to the obſervation of thoſe Laws, to whoſe conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they give no conſent, the wiſdome of former times gave proxies unto this Houſe meerly upon this ground, that every one might have a hand in the making of that, which he had an Obligation to obey: This Houſe could not repreſent, therefore proxies in room of perſons were moſt juſtly allowed.</p>
            <p>And now my Lords, before I conclude, I beſeech your Lordſhips to caſt your eyes upon the Church, which I know is moſt deare and tender to your Lordſhips, you will ſee her ſuffer in her moſt princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall members, and deprived of that honour which here and throughout all the Chriſtian World ever ſince Chriſtianity ſhe conſtantly hath enjoyed; for what Nation or Kingdome is there in whoſe great and publike aſſemblies, and that from, her begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, ſhee had not ſome of hers if I may not ſay as eſſentiall, I am ſure I may ſay as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrall,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:157486:4"/> parts thereof, and truly my Lords, Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anitie cannot alone boaſt of this or challenge it on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as hers, even Heatheniſme claimes an equall ſhare.</p>
            <p>I never read of any of them, Civill or Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, that gave not thus much to their Religion, ſo that it ſeems to me to have no other originall, to flow from no other ſpring than Nature it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>But I have done, and will trouble your Lordſhips no longer, how it may ſtand with the honour and juſtice of this Houſe to p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſſe this Bill, I moſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſubmit unto your Lordſhips, the moſt proper and only Judges of them both.</p>
